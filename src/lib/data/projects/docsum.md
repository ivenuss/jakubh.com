## Goal

The main goal of this project was to learn how to create dynamic documentation that is automatically rendered from MD/MDX content and to learn some new technologies.

## Design

The documentation layout was inspired by [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), because I think their layout is one of the best according to UI/UX. I added more features and changed the UI.

## Technologies

The website is built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), because I think it's currently the best solution for SEO according to documentation and static generation. It is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

Some functions according to Contentlayer library were taken from the Contentlayer [website](https://www.contentlayer.dev/), because there is not much documentation yet.

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Styles**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Content Buuilder**: [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/)
- **Search Component**: [kbar](https://github.com/timc1/kbar)

### Kbar Search
